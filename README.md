![Next.js + TS + MUI Netlify Create Starter](https://assets.stackbit.com/docs/ts-nextjs-starter-thumb.png)

This is a minimal starting point for new Netlify Create projects. It is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and [MUI](https://mui.com/), and is equipped with visual editing capabilities using Netlify Create. It uses markdown files as the the [Git Content Source](https://docs.netlify.com/create/content-sources/git/).

**âš¡ View demo:** [ts-mui-starter.netlify.app](https://ts-mui-starter.netlify.app/)

## Features

This is meant to be a simple starting point that demonstrates the use of bringing your own component library, such as MUI.

In addition to MUI support, this project contains the following:

- **Flexible Pages:** Simple and flexible page model that lets editors add new pages.
- **Basic Components:** A few basic components to add to new pages.
- **Layout Elements:** Header and footer elements automatically added to pages.
- **Component & Template Presets:** Predefined arrangements of content and components for faster editing. [Learn more](https://docs.netlify.com/create/content-presets/).
- **TypeScript Support:** Components and content are type-safe. (See `types` directory for definitions.)

## Getting Started

The typical development process is to begin by working locally. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
cd ts-mui-nextjs-starter
npm run dev
```

Install the [Netlify Create CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stackbit/cli). Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Netlify Create Dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Netlify Create URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Netlify Create's visual editor for your new project.
